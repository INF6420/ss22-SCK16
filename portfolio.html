        <h2> My Academic Journey</h2>
        <p> I attended and graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn with a Bachelor of Arts, having majored in History. Then as I worked in public libraries I found myself loving the role I could play connecting people to information, which led me to Wayne State's Library and Information Science program! As can be seen below, I have an interest in theology that I have looked to bring to the fore in my studies, as I'm particularly interested in theological librarianship. I plan on seeking to attain a Theological Studies Master's degree to strengthen my studies in that field as well.</p>
