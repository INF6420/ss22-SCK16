        <h2>Steve Kays</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Steve Kays. I'm a current Library and Information
          Science graduate student at Wayne State University. I consider myself
          a life-long student, and I love how the field of librarianship
          nurtures that instinct; I also love working with and helping people,
          meeting their needs. I also have a specific interest in the field of
          theology. What better way to combine those interests and passions than
          to aspire to be a theological librarian!
        </p>
        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>
          I live in Canton, Michigan and have the fortunate opportunity of
          working in my hometown public library as a Circulation Assistant. I
          also sub at the Novi Public Library in the same capacity. I also have
          several other personal interests. I am a self-described film nerd,
          love being out in nature, and enjoy spending quality time with family
          and friends.
        </p>
